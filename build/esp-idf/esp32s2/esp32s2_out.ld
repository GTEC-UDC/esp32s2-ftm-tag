/* ESP32S2 Linker Script Memory Layout

   This file describes the memory layout (memory blocks) by virtual memory addresses.

   This linker script is passed through the C preprocessor to include configuration options.

   Please use preprocessor features sparingly!
   Restrict to simple macros with numeric values, and/or #if/#endif blocks.
