    config FTM_TARGET_CHANNEL
        int "Channel for FTM operation"
        default 6
        range 1 14
        help
            Wi-Fi channel on which the anchor and tag operate.
            This should match the anchor's configured channel.

    config FTM_USE_40MHZ_BANDWIDTH
        bool "Use 40MHz bandwidth"
        default y
        help
            Enable to use 40MHz bandwidth for FTM operations.
            This should match the anchor's bandwidth setting.

    config FTM_SCAN_ALL_CHANNELS
        bool "Scan all channels"
        default n
        help
            If enabled, will scan all channels instead of just the target channel.
            Might help find anchors that are misconfigured.

    config FTM_AP_PREFIX
        string "FTM AP prefix"
        default "ftm_"
        help
            Prefix used to identify FTM-capable access points.
            Access points with SSIDs starting with this prefix will be considered FTM anchors.

    config TREAT_ALL_AP_AS_FTM
        bool "Treat all APs as FTM responders"
        default y
        help
            If enabled, all detected access points will be treated as FTM responders
            regardless of their actual capabilities. Useful for debugging.
